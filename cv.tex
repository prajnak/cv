\part{Prajna Kandarpa}
I'm well-versed in software development, web development, audio visual media development and am in the process of honing my machine learning based data analysis skills. I also have more than a passing interest in the fields of social sciences and psychology. I'd like to work in a position where I would be able to utilize these skills while being able to learn new ones in any domain.
