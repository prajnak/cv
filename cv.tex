\part{Prajna Kandarpa}
I'm well-versed in software development, web development, audio visual media development and am in the process of honing my machine learning based data analysis skills. I also have more than a passing interest in the fields of social sciences and psychology. I'd like to work in a position where I would be able to utilize these skills while being able to learn new ones in any domain.

        {Exploratory analysis of a youtube video characteristics dataset to identify important variables, strong correlations and be able predict video transcoding times between formats. Datset had 4 codecs, various video input/output sizes, bitrates and framerates. Models were built after data-preprocessing, test/training split, k-fold cross-validation, training, model parameter tuning and finally, model cross-validation.}
        
     \item{'14}
         {Autonomous Speed Boat}
         {In this group project, our team built an autonomous miniature speedboat controlled using an Arduino microcontroller. The boat used infrared sensors for path detection and feedback based control. The hull is 3-d printed with fibreglass epoxy coating to counteract the porous 3d printing material. Responsible for runtime software and control system implementation.}
